# Search-engine
A search engine using NLP (lem , stop word , vectorization , etc) 

Search engine

Using this pre-processing technique can improve the quality of the text:

- Removing punctuation marks

- Stop word removal

- Tokenization

- Lemmatization

After extracting all the tokens that we need, we vectorize each of them.

We are utilizing Term-frequency

And in the end, we calculate the cosine similarity of the documents and compare it with the input of the search, and the most closely related document will be displayed in the text box.

Search.py is for searching, and Tables.py shwoing vectorizetion before calculating term frequency.
